Minesweeper

Let's re-create Minesweeper in Ruby! We'll use the gosu library to handle the graphics and input code. To represent our game we can define a new class called Minefield which manages the state of the world. In this challenge we provide the setup code and a bare-bones implementation of Minefield and you have to flesh it out to end up with a functional game.
